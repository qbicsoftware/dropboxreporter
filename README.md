Reports stuff that happened on a particular day, based on the logs of the dropboxhandler.

## How to use
Currently, the dropboxreporter only summarizes log events, given a certain date in format **'YYYY-MM-DD'**.

### Commandline interface
The dropboxreporter can be executed, after compiling the the source code. You can then summarize a log file by calling:

    > dropboxhandler.jar [date] [/path/to/logfile.log]

Be aware that the **date** must have the **format** 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

### Example output
If the parsing was successful, you will see an output similar to this:

    Log file parsed successfully.

The lines 

    Log overview
    Date: 2017-03-20
    Log: /home/sven/dropboxhandler.log
    
show again the input parameters. ```Date``` is the date you wanted the summary for. ```Log``` respectively shows the path to the log file you wanted to be searched.

The line

     Project code: QSGPR

obviously reports a summary for a found project code. All files with barcodes belonging to this particular project will be summarized as

    numberOfManualIntervention: 0
    numberOfIncomingFiles: 2
    
meaning the number files for the project that still need manual intervention (e.g. the target dropbox was wrong or there was no matching rule defined in the dropboxhandler config) and the total
number of incoming files for that project are displayed.

In case of incoming files that need manual intervention (because they don't carry a valid barcode or just have none), it will be summarized
like in this example:

    Files without barcode: 2
    Filepath:	/mnt/nfs/qbic/dropboxes/manual/qeana07-pct/20170320131133_20140523_CO_0480SiDG_R02_OG_04.raw
